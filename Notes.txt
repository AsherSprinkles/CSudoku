    How do we find out if a solution is unique?
        After doing this, I can work on removing values from the grid to make a game
    Turn sudoku.c into a library with .h file
    Clean up curs.c?
    Make function in curs.c that prints a sudoku grid to the screen
        Set apart values that are actually part of the grid from player-created values
            possibly by inverting text, or bolding it.


Uniqueness of solution...
1 Initialize solution space by checking which values are valid for all cells
2 Set all single values
3 Back to 1 until no single values remain
4 If any solution vector exists with size > 1, return not unique.
5 Else, return unique.

Backtracking to count number of solutions:

Next thing I want to do is generate the minimum sudoku for a given grid
